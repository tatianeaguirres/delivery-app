## Technical debts

What I still need to do:

#### **`<NewDelivery/>` Component**

- Integrate country selection with address input to only show autocomplete suggestions for that country.
- Integrate the map with the address input and mark the pickup and delivery route on the map.

#### **`<MyDeliveries/>` Component**

- Create a Collapsible, that expand when clicked on, to display the data. They allow it to hide content that is not immediately relevant to the user.

#### **`<Menu/>` Component**

- Create logic to display how many current and past delivery requests are open in the menu.

#### **`<History/>` Component**

- Create a `<History/>` component to show past delivery requests.

#### **`<Modal/>` Component**

- Create a `<Modal/>` component to display the messages.

#### **API**

- Adds a [Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to catch JavaScript errors.

#### **Responsive Design**

- I am already working in the `responsive-design` branch where I am rewriting the layout using mobile first technique, [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) and flex-box system for mobile, tablet and desktop resolutions.
